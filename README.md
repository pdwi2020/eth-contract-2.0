# Getting Started

Welcome to the Next.js documentation!

If you're new to Next.js, we recommend starting with the learn course. The interactive course with quizzes will guide you through everything you need to know to use Next.js.

If you have questions about anything related to Next.js, you're always welcome to ask our community on GitHub Discussions.

System Requirements
Node.js 14.6.0 or newer
MacOS, Windows (including WSL), and Linux are supported
Automatic Setup
We recommend creating a new Next.js app using create-next-app, which sets up everything automatically for you. (You don't need to create an empty directory. create-next-app will make one for you.) To create a project, run:

### 'npx create-next-app@latest'

# or

### 'yarn create next-app'

# or

### 'pnpm create next-app'

If you want to start with a TypeScript project you can use the --typescript flag:

### 'npx create-next-app@latest --typescript'

# or

### 'yarn create next-app --typescript'

# or

### 'pnpm create next-app --typescript'

After the installation is complete:

Run npm run dev or yarn dev or pnpm dev to start the development server on http://localhost:3000
Visit http://localhost:3000 to view your application
Edit pages/index.js and see the updated result in your browser
For more information on how to use create-next-app, you can review the create-next-app documentation.

Manual Setup
Install next, react and react-dom in your project:

### 'npm install next react react-dom'

# or

### 'yarn add next react react-dom'

# or

### 'pnpm add next react react-dom'

Open package.json and add the following scripts:

"scripts": {
"dev": "next dev",
"build": "next build",
"start": "next start",
"lint": "next lint"
}
These scripts refer to the different stages of developing an application:

dev - Runs next dev to start Next.js in development mode
build - Runs next build to build the application for production usage
start - Runs next start to start a Next.js production server
lint - Runs next lint to set up Next.js' built-in ESLint configuration
Create two directories pages and public at the root of your application:

pages - Associated with a route based on their file name. For example, pages/about.js is mapped to /about
public - Stores static assets such as images, fonts, etc. Files inside public directory can then be referenced by your code starting from the base URL (/).
Next.js is built around the concept of pages. A page is a React Component exported from a .js, .jsx, .ts, or .tsx file in the pages directory. You can even add dynamic route parameters with the filename.

Inside the pages directory, add the index.js file to get started. This is the page that is rendered when the user visits the root of your application.

Populate pages/index.js with the following contents:

function HomePage() {
return <div>Welcome to Next.js!</div>
}

export default HomePage
After the set up is complete:

Run npm run dev or yarn dev or pnpm dev to start the development server on http://localhost:3000
Visit http://localhost:3000 to view your application
Edit pages/index.js and see the updated result in your browser
So far, we get:

Automatic compilation and bundling
React Fast Refresh
Static generation and server-side rendering of pages/
Static file serving through public/ which is mapped to the base URL (/)
In addition, any Next.js application is ready for production from the start. Read more in our Deployment documentation.
